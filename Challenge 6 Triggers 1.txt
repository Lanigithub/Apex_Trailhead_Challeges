// Trigger.New : Returns a list of the new versions of the sObject records.
// This sObject list is only available in insert, update, and undelete triggers, and the records can only be modified in before triggers.
// Pre-Work: ( go to setup for field management choose field and relationship check "Checkbox")
//Add a checkbox field to the Account object:

//Field Label: Match Billing Address
//Field Name: Match_Billing_Address
//Note: The resulting API Name should be Match_Billing_Address__c.
// Go to any account to add address to the Billing and then the shipping address will be recorded as well
//  So let's record the ShippingAddress and BillingAdress as well and then update any field
