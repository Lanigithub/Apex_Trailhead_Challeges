2. Control Access to Objects: 
You can set object permissions with profiles or permission sets. Each user is assigned one profile. 
Users can be assigned one or more permission sets.

Managing Profiles:
Setup-> Profiles->select Profiles to view

Create a Profile
The easiest way to create a profile is to clone an existing profile that’s similar to the one you want to create, and then modify it.
Salesforce has an enhanced profile user interface that makes it easy to find and modify profile settings. That’s what we’ll use for this exercise.

-> From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter User Management Settings, and then select User Management Settings. Enable Enhanced Profile User Interface.
Create:
->From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Profiles, and then select Profiles.
->Click Clone next to a profile similar to the one you want to create.
->Give your new profile a name, and save.

Go to App  => pick Object Settings->pick objects( accounts, contacts, leads...) to Edit and check the box of " Edit, read.."
->save

3. Control Access to fields:
Setup->Profiles-> clone Standard User->enter profile name: Sales -> Click on Objects Settings->Click on Accounts=>Edit
Object permission  for Accounts: Read, Create, Edit -> Field Persmissions: Rating: No access ( uncheck rating access)->save
back to Object Settings-> Click on Contacts->Edit-> Choose Read Create Edit for Object Permissions->save

Add Field Access with a Permission Set
Setup-> Permission Sets->New -> Label: Rating; API Name: Rating; Liscense: Salesforce Or None->Save
->Back to Permission sets ->Choose Rating-> Object Settings-> Accounts-> Control Field Permissions: Rating for Read and Edit->save

Plural Label: Projects
Object Name: Project
Record Name: Project Name
Record Name Data Type: Text

Configure organization-wide default sharing settings:
 for the Project object so that Project 
records are visible only to the record owner and to users above them in the role hierarchy.

Setup->Sharing Settings->Edit-> Find the Object Project and deselect the checkbox for Role Hierarchy and change all to private
