## **Apex_Trailhead_Challeges**
### **Challenge 1:**
### **Challenge 2:  Create an Apex class with a method that returns an array ( or list) of strings**

#### * Create an Apex class with a method that returns an array ( or list) of formatted **_strings('Test0', 'Test1',..)_** 
#### * The length of the array is determined by an **_integer parameter_**
#### * The Apex class must be called StringArrayTest and be in the public scope
#### *  The apex class must have a public static method called **_generateStringArray_**
#### *  The **_generateStringArray_** method must return an array ( or list) of **_strings_**.
#### *  The method must accept an incoming Integer as a parameter, which will be used to determine the number of retuening strings
#### *  The method must return a string value in the format **_Testn _** where n is the index of the current dstring in the array



### **Challenge 3: Create a method for inserting accounts. ( Manipulate Records with DML)**

#### * To pass this challenge, create an **Apex class** that **inserts a new account** named after an incoming **_parameter_**.
#### If the account is successfully inserted, the method should **return** the account record. If a DML **exception** occurs, the method should **return _null_**.
#### * The Apex class must be called **_AccountHandler_** and be in the **public** scope
#### * The Apex class must have a **public static method** called **_insertNewAccount_**
#### * The method must accept an incoming **_string_ as a parameter**, which will be used to create the **Account name**
#### * The method must **insert the account** into the system and then **return** the record
#### * The method must also accept an **empty string**, **catch the failed DML and then return _null_**
